INITIAL_INVESTIGATION
    Matthew crawled out of his sleeping place to find that the people below were holding a community chili testing
    picnic in the park nearby. He could make out the shapes of chili pots, some people, and a large pond.

LEAVE_TOWER_GET_CHILI
    Matthew felt compeled. He felt that he had to go to the chili. He climbd down his tower abode and slowly made
    his way to the park... There it was. There Matthew saw the most beautiful thing his beady little eyes had ever
    looked upon. There, was Le Or Chile

        *CHILI_THOUGHTFUL_INSPECT Inspect the chili closer

CHILI_JUMP_IN_POT
    Matthew was unable to resist, this may be his only oppurtunity. He looked upon the large pot before him, big
    enough to fit a wheelbarrow. He steped a few paces backwards, as a few people turned to look at what he was doing.
    He got a running start, and he leaped! He yelled out into the sky, 'WHAHOOIE!!!!' The people slowly watched him in
    immense surprise, and terror, as he landed into the chili. The chili was flung everywhere by the splash, those near where he jumped
    were blinded, some with irreversable damage, most of the families who had come to take part in the chili tasting were
    traumatized, and several people were on the phone with the authorities. But none of that mattered to Matthew. Because, for a           
    brief, fleeting moment in time, Matthew got to live his dream.

CHILI_EAT_WITH_SPOON
    Matthew held himself back. As much as he wanted to jump in that pot, he decided he would use the serving spoons that were supplied
    as to not pull too much attention to himself. Matthew was a vigilante after all.
    He grabbed a plastic spoon with his right hand, and clasped it in his fist. He shakily lowered the spoon into the chili, and brought
    it back up to take a bite. Matthew spoke. 'Huh. This chili is pretty bland-' *BWOOOOM!* Matthew then exploded into glitter.

CHILI_THOUGHTFUL_INSPECT
    Matthew decided to more closely inspect the chili. As he grazed his eyes overtop the shimmering surface, he saw a fly swoop down and land
    on the chili. Matthew was disgusted. He grabbed the pot of chili, looked at the fly, and he said, 'You are an abomination.' Matthew then
    screamed with rage as he threw the pot of chili with all of his strength, straight into the sun.

LEAVE_TOWER_HAVE_CONVERSATION
    Matthew thought that he would take this oppurtunity to engage in social activity. He hardly ever got out anymore, so he saw this as
    a perfect chance. Matthew climbed out of his fun little home, and entered the park. He looked around and saw three potential persons
    to talk to. There was a small boy with a interesting looking box, a large muscular man, and a normal looking guy.
        *CONVERSE_BOX_BOY Talk to the boy
        *CONVERSE_MUSCLE_MAN Talk to the muscular man
        *CONVERSE_REGULAR_GUY Talk to the guy

CONVERSE_BOX_BOY
    Matthew walked up to the small boy. 'Hi there little boy, what do you have there?' He asked. The boy responded, in the deepest voice Matthew
    had ever heard, 'Right here I have a self-sustaining ecosystem of foreign metal-eating beetles. If you don't surrender and come with us, I will
    release them from this box and they will destroy your home, the Eiffel Tower. Afterwards they will wreck complete havoc on the entirety of
    France. If you do agree to come along with us, we'll spare the Eiffel Tower, and France will go on peacefully.' Matthew couldn't belive what he
    was hearing. This was terrible. Be he had a feeling he knew who was behind this... 'So, what are you going to choose Matthew? I'll give
    you ten seconds to pick.' $[prompt_options] Matthew couldn't believe he had fallen for one of their feindish tricks again. He looked around
    the chili tasting event, and watched every person there reveal a tattoo of a fish. He knew these people, they meant buisiness. But he also
    knew their management was never far away. If he could figure a way out of this, maybe he could take down the organization for good.
    His thoughts were interrupted. 'Tick tock Matthew! What'll it be?'

BOX_BOY_SURRENDERR
    Matthew bent down on his knees and held his wrists out towards the boy. He stared at him with strong emotions behind his eyes. 'Ah, good choice.' The boy grabbed
    strange pair of handcuffs and placed them on Matthews wrists. 'You are hereby under arrest for crimes against our organization. You will spend time in our prison
    until management feel that you've learned your place.' The boy pulled out what looked like a normal TV remote. He bent down and whispered, 'See you around Matthew.' He
    pushed a button on the remote, and Matthew began to feel tingly and odd. Before he could figure out what was going on, everything around him was fuzzy, and he was
    vanishing from the park, appearing in some strange new room. He was sligthly nauseous from whatever just happened to him, and he took a moment to get his bearings. Once
    he felt better, he looked around, and saw that he was in a solid walled-in room with nothing but an empty bucket, a dirty sink, and a speaker built in to the wall.
    On the floor in front of him there was a scrap of paper. He picked it up and looked at it. It was covered it strange scrawled writing. Matthew began to read
    the note off to himself. 'ThE WaLLs ArE ThIn. BrEAk ThEm. 2093088372619-28' Weird.

        *JAIL_WALLBREAK 'Well, I'll break the walls I guess'
        *JAIL_REHYDRATE Drink some water
        *JAIL_RELAX Just enjoy your time here

JAIL_WALLBREAK
    Matthew decided that he would do what the note said, and he would break the walls. Despite his handcuffs, he picked up the bucket from the ground, and he
    swung it at one of the walls. To his surprise, the wall didn't just break, it fell over flat like a cardboard cut-out. On the other side of the flat wall what seemed
    to be a large, empty, abandoned library. The room was eerily dark, and it was totally empty besides a couple of chairs that were randomly placed, one of which was knocked over.
    'Where the heck am I?' Matthew wondered to himself aloud. His words reverberated off the walls. He began to walk around. He saw a large double door on the
    opposite end of the room, and there was an exit sign above it. Suddenly, Matthew heard a sound behind him, and turned to see an elevator door with a lit-up arrow
    above it pointing down, signifying that an elevator was on it's way. It was slowly getting audibly closer.
